# GetListFromURL
GetListFromURL dose a search on a specified URL and saves the part data that is between the HTML search term you input,
then saves that info to a text file.

Example:

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

Search Start Term: <a href="
Search End Term: "

Fetching everything between every <a href=" "

Exampel search result: /wiki/Ernie_Toshack

This dose not always give you the result you are looking for, you therefor need a BASIC understanding of HTML, to look at the code and change your search terms.

Trail and error! :)
